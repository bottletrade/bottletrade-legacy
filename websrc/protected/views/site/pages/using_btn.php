			BottleTrade is a social network of craft beer enthusiasts, collectors and traders that allows users to create 
			profiles, upload their bottles into a Cyber Cellar and interact with others to establish trades amongst 
			each other. We created BottleTrade with the intention of bridging the gap between traders across the 
			entire country and world so that others can have the opportunity to try beverages that are not available 
			in certain markets due to distribution and production limitations. We encourage you to watch our videos 
			below to see how the BottleTrade network works. Happy Trading!
