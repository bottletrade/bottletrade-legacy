		RULE #1
	</span>
	<br /><br />
	<span class="black">
		All trading shall be based on a bottle-for-a-bottle barter. There is to be no exchange of cash of any kind at any time. It is up to the two trading parties to determine the market value of their bottles and ultimately, what they are willing to trade for another party's bottle. This includes multiple bottles for a single bottle if both parties agree to the trade.
	</span>
	<br /><br />
	<span class="black bold">
		RULE #2
	</span>
	<br /><br />
	<span class="black">
		Any damaged or potentially hazardous bottles should not be made available for trade on the network. This includes bottles with cracks, chips or that have been previously opened. We strive for a standard of quality amongst the BottleTrade community and want traders to receive the best value for their trade. Sending a damaged bottle would be a great way to get a terrible review.
	</span>
	<br /><br />
	<span class="black bold">
		RULE #3
	</span>
	<br /><br />
	<span class="black">
		Once a trade has been established between two parties, a good review should be contingent upon the bottles being shipped by both users within 10 business days of the trade. It is recommended that both parties agree on a "trade date," in which they ship and provide tracking numbers to each other on an agreed date. For example, John and Joe have established a trade on Jan. 19th. They have agreed to mail their shipments and provide tracking numbers to each other by Jan. 21st. Easy as pie, right? Don’t ruin your rep by sticking your finger in that pie.
	</span>
	<br /><br />
	<span class="black bold">
		RULE #4
	</span>
	<br /><br />
	<span class="black">
	Both parties are responsible for taking extra precaution in ensuring that their bottles are properly packaged for shipment. You can learn more about packaging bottles on our <a href="<?php echo UrlUtils::generateUrl(UrlUtils::EducateUri);  ?>">Educate Page</a>. Remember, your user rating is contingent upon many aspects of a trade, including the quality of the bottle upon arrival.
	</span>
	<br /><br />
	<span class="black bold">
		RULE #5
	</span>
	<br /><br />
	<span class="black">
		It is illegal to ship alcohol through the United States Postal Service (USPS), so it comes recommended that one ships through private shipping companies (i.e. FedEx, UPS, etc.). When shipments are dropped off, keep in mind the "don't ask, don't tell" policy, since they discourage these types of shipment as well. If they don't ask what is in a package, then don't tell them. If they do ask, it is as simple as telling them you're shipping bottles of olive oil or if you want to be more truthful, samples of yeast; which is 100% true. Remember, we are all part of an underground movement, so play it smart.
	</span>
	<br /><br />
	<span class="black bold">
		RULE #6
	</span>
	<br /><br />
	<span class="black">
		Once both parties have received and confirmed their shipments, they will be responsible for completing the trade on their BottleTrade profiles. This is as easy as clicking "Bottles Received" checkbox on the Trade Details page, which in turn asks each user to leave a trader review on the others party's profile. Leaving a trader review is required as it helps to strengthen our "good faith" system. These will not be directly editable by the user on the receiving end of a review, and is all a reflection of your seriousness as a bottle trader.
	</span>
	<br /><br />
	<span class="black bold">
		RULE #7
	</span>
	<br /><br />
	<span class="black">
		We here at BottleTrade have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to "bad traders." If you violate any of the above said rules, your account will be suspended and/or permanently deleted depending on the gravity of the offense. Establishing a solid reputation as a trader is the most important rule to live by in our community, so treat each trade and other traders with respect, honesty, fairness and patience.
	</span>
	<br /><br />
	<span class="black bold">
		RULE #8
	</span>
	<br /><br />
	<span class="black">
		Pop open your bottle, pour it into your finest glassware and enjoy the liquid gold. This is our most treasured rule on BottleTrade since in the end, we all share the same passion, love and respect for the craft beers, wines and spirits that we drink. After all, BottleTrade wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
